# Graphmaster
By Erik Karlsson

If you want to run this project yourself:
* install yarn on your computer
* install virtual env in api folder and then activate it
* install packages necessary in venv (flask, dotenv, flask-praetorian, etc)
* in graphmaster folder: `yarn install`
* `yarn start`
* Ã­n separate terminal: `yarn start-api`
* go to localhost 5000

You probably need to run it on linux or do like me, ubuntu on WSL :)
